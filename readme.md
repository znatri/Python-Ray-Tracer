# Ray Tracer in Python

This is a ray tracer implementation in Python, which simulates the path of light rays to render 3D scenes as 2D images. The project features intersection tests with spheres and triangles, diffuse shading, shadows, and reflections, creating visually appealing images of 3D scenes.

## Features
Initialize 3D scenes
Cast eye rays into the scene for each pixel
Test rays for intersection with spheres and triangles
Use the diffuse shading equation to find the color for each pixel
Enhance the shading function with ambient and specular terms
Cast shadows using rays at light sources
Implement reflection using recursion


## Installation 
1. Download and install Processing 3.
2. Clone this repository or download the source code.
3. Open the Processing project located in the raytracer folder.


## Usage 
1. Run the program in Processing by selecting the "Run" option in the menu.
2. The program will open a window with a simple user interface, where you can adjust the parameters of the ray tracer and create your own scene.
3. Select the number keys (1-9) to create different images based on predefined test scenes.

For more information on creating custom scenes or modifying the ray tracer, refer to the source code comments.
