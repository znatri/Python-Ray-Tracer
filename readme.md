# Ray Tracer in Python

This project involves writing a Ray Tracer in Python. It consists of a collection of functions that initialize a 3D scene and produce 2D images of the scene. The first part of the project involves writing a 
ray tracer that casts eye rays into the scene for each pixel, tests the rays for intersection with spheres, and uses the diffuse shading equation to find the color for each pixel. 

The second part of the project expands the ray tracer to include triangles, shadows, and reflections. The shading function will be enhanced to have an ambient and a specular term to give more variety to 
surfaces. Shadows will be cast by rays at light sources. Finally, reflection will be implemented using recursion. Test scenes will be provided for testing the ray tracer.

## Features
The project includes several features and functions: 
- Initializing a 3D scene 
- Casting eye rays into the scene for each pixel 
- Testing the rays for intersection with spheres 
- Using the diffuse shading equation to find the color for each pixel 
- Enhancing the shading function with an ambient and a specular term 
- Casting shadows by rays at light sources 
- Implementing reflection using recursion

## Installation 
1. Download and install [Processing 3](https://processing.org/download/). 
2. Download and extract the source code from the GitHub repository. 
3. Open the Processing project in the “raytracer” folder. 
4. Run the program and select the “Run” option in the menu. 

## Usage 
The program will open a window with a simple user interface. You can adjust the parameters of the ray tracer and create a scene of your own. You can select the 
number 1-9 option to create the image.
